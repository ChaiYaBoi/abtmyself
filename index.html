    <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
    <p>My name is Chaithra (Reddy) Marella :D This is my lil' zone in the world!</p>
    <p>It's nice, y'know, realizing that this is my forever mark on the world until the death of websites and the consuption of the world into flames.</p>
<p>No matter, whether you're here to see who I am, rate this website, learn a lil' more abot me, it's a pleasure to meet you!</p>
<p> As of 2024, I am a freshmen at Great Hearts. This school is nice. I like it. I've actally been here since kindergarden! I've always had a passion for the arts, whether it be actually drawing, or writing. I actually aspire to be a novelist as a side gig when I get older. I do traditional and digital art, and I apparetly have a kinda silly artstyle. I often listen to vocaloid songs, and I listen to the indie music genre, and dabble in some areas into the rock and metal realm.</p>
<p>I have several intrests, like Sky: Children of the Light, Bungo Stray Dogs, Hoyoverse Games, and the Rick Riordan Books</p>
